# Virtual Printer Settings

Add easily configurable and well organised settings for OctoPrint's virtual printer.
Overrides the default template which only has an enabling checkbox.

Very useful if you are developing plugins, or even core OctoPrint. No more digging deep into config.yaml and hoping you typed the settings correctly!

### This plugin is not under _active_ development, but if you have any problems, or feature requests I would be happy to take a look & see what I can do.

## Compatibility

### Browser

This plugin uses some modern browser features and as a result it won't work correctly on older browsers that do not support
ES6 JS features. I've tested it on modern Chromium-based browsers, and it works fine for me, if you have issues with a particular
browser, please let me know.

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome, there is nothing too special about developing this plugin. If you can run the pre-commit
checks below after your changes are made that would be great.

**Pre-commit**

- `pre-commit run --hook-stage manual --all-files` to run all of the checks

## Configuration

Plugin adds settings to OctoPrint's UI that are [documented here](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/development/virtual_printer.html#virtual-printer-configuration-options)

It replaces the original implementation, introduced in OctoPrint 1.4.1
